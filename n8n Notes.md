n8n is an workflow automation and integration platform designed to connect various apps, services, and systems visually and programmatically. It enables users to build automated pipelines—so-called “workflows”—without needing extensive coding, yet gives developers the flexibility to extend via custom code or self-hosting.


Cost: n8n can be significantly cheaper than Zapier, especially for high-volume or complex automation, due to its self-hosted option and a pricing model based on full workflow executions rather than per-task actions

An execution is a single run of your entire workflow. It doesn’t matter how many steps are in the workflow or how much data it processes — it’s still a single execution.
This makes your usage more predictable than other tools where you pay individually for every step or task. Plus n8n workflows you can do things in a single execution that would take 10,000 operations in other tools.

N8n vs Zapier/Make:
* Zapier: Easiest
* Make (Integromat): Moderate
* n8n: Steeper learning curve; designed for developers & power users. Open source. Able to self host.



Nodes fall into categories:
*  Trigger Nodes: Event-based (e.g., “On form submission”) — no API call, just a listener.
*  Action Nodes: Often API calls (e.g., Slack, Jira, Google Sheets).
*  Logic Nodes: No API calls — just control flow (if/else, loops, merge).
*  Data Nodes: Transform/manipulate data (formatting text, parsing JSON).
*  Code Nodes: Run custom JavaScript — no external API unless you add one.

Choose n8n if:
* You’re tired of metered pricing draining your budget.
* Data privacy is non-negotiable.
* You crave customizability (from no-code to full-stack tinkering).
* AI autonomy is on your roadmap.

Stick with Zapier/Make if:
* You need plug-and-play simplicity.
* Your workflows are basic and low-volume.
