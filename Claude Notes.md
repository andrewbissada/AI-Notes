**Projects**
Similar to ChatGPT

**Project Knowledge vs Description**
Think of Project Knowledge as "what Claude should know" (facts, data, references) and Project Description as "how Claude should behave" (instructions, goals, approach). Knowledge is your reference library, while Description/Notes is your instruction manual.

**Artifacts**
This is somewhat unique to Claude. Its different than canvas in ChatGPT. It can actually show interactive view of a website for example, and allow you to publish it to a link that can be shared on the web!

**Connect Apps**
Connect Google Docs, Github, etc
