# What is a Canvas?
The canvas is your main workspace in n8n — it’s where you drag, drop, and connect nodes to build your automation visually.

# Nodes?
Nodes are the building blocks of an automation — each one represents a step, like receiving form data, applying conditions, or sending a Slack message.

# Form Node
How to Pin Data and why?
Click the Pin button top right.  Purpose: So you don’t have to fill out the form every test run.

# Conditional Node
“A conditional node checks whether certain rules are true or false, and then routes the workflow down the right path.”

# Variables
Variables are placeholders for dynamic values like dates, emails, or names — they let your workflow handle real data instead of hardcoding values.
# Methods (toDateTime for robustness)
Change name to be more clear “is within 7 days?” is the true condition

#Slack Node
Different option types. Select “Send a message”
Execute Step to test. Look at Slack Channel for result
