When to use GHL Automations vs Make.com
Use GHL Automations when everything happens inside one client’s sub-account and needs to be instant: form submitted → create/move opportunity, send SMS/email, assign user, appointment reminders, missed-call text-back, stage-based follow-ups, round-robin.


Use Make.com when you need to leave GHL or span multiple sub-accounts: sync to Airtable/Sheets, cross-client rollups, Slack/Discord alerts, Google Slides/PDF report generation, external API enrichment, AI content drafting, nightly batch jobs.
Use GHL Automations when the action stays inside GHL (one sub-account) and you don’t need external files/datasets.
 Examples: create/move opportunities, send SMS/email, missed-call text-back, appointment reminders, stage-based nurtures. GHL is built for these and can trigger instantly. HighLevel Support Portal


Use Make (or n8n/Zapier) when the action leaves GHL (even if it’s for a single client): pushing data to Airtable/Sheets, generating Slides/PDFs, posting to Slack, blending ad-spend + revenue, or doing cross-system logic. GHL supports outbound webhooks specifically for this purpose. HighLevel Support Portal+1
